# Guardrails & stop severity

Five severity levels. Use the lightest that still keeps overnight safe.

## Severity table

| Severity | Verb | Effect |
|----------|------|--------|
| **Skip item** | `skipped` | Leave item; pick next. No PR. Note in morning brief. |
| **Block item** | `blocked` | Same as skip for queue progress, but `blockReason` required (`needs-info`, `needs-grill`, `tests`, `hitl`, `ci-red`, `interrupted`, …). Deferred ledger — must not vanish. |
| **Soft-park** | park | End this WHILE; **keep** sentinel (FOR). No `stoppedAt`. Set optional `parkedReason` on state. Next wake: refresh Sources / re-check budget; resume if work returns. Morning brief only on true stop (user-stop / escalate / hard stop). |
| **Stop loop** | stop | Kill sentinel / do not re-arm; write morning brief; persist coarse `stopReason` + optional `stopDetail` ([state-schema.md](./state-schema.md)). Clear `parkedReason` if set. |
| **Escalate** | stop + alert | Stop loop **and** surface hard safety (auth/secrets/denylist) first in Summary — human must act before next AFK. |

## Condition → severity map

On **Stop loop**, set coarse `stopReason` (`done` / `blocked` / `noop` / `budget`) and `stopDetail` as noted.

| Condition | Severity | `stopReason` / `stopDetail` or park |
|-----------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| Vague acceptance; inventable scope | **Block item** | (item) `needs-info` or `needs-grill`; never invent |
| HITL / product decision / design-only | **Block item** or **Skip item** | Prefer `blocked` + `hitl` |
| Wayfinder grilling / prototype HITL ticket | **Skip item** | Do not resolve overnight |
| Tests / verification fail after one fix attempt | **Block item** | `tests` or `verification-failed` |
| Item `verification[]` present but skipped/weakened to force pass | **Block item** + note | Never green-wash — [readiness.md](./readiness.md) |
| `risk: high` without kickoff `allowHighRisk: true` | **Skip item** | Leave for daytime; do not invent low risk |
| Empty queue (no agent-ready work) mid-run | **Soft-park** | `parkedReason: empty-queue` — **keep** sentinel; dry-run still **Stop loop** `noop` / `dry-run` |
| `prs.length >= maxPrs` | **Soft-park** | `parkedReason: maxPrs` — **keep** sentinel until human stop or `maxPrs` raised / PRs closed |
| User: stop after-hours / stop loop | **Stop loop** | `done` / `user-stop` — kill **all** matching sentinel PIDs |
| IDE / tool **interrupt** mid-item | **Block item** | (item) `interrupted` — **keep** sentinel; see [tick-and-runners](./tick-and-runners.md) |
| Dirty tree from interrupted claim; recovered (safe checkout / discarded half-work) | continue | Park item `interrupted`; do **not** Stop loop solely for this |
| Dirty tree unrecovered at tick start and `safety.stopOnDirtyTree` | **Stop loop** | `blocked` / `dirty-interrupt` (known interrupt residue) or `preflight` (unknown dirty) |
| Staged/changed path matches `safety.pathDenylist` | **Escalate** | `blocked` / `guardrail` — before commit/push; never open PR |
| Auth / webhook / guard **weakening** and `safety.stopOnAuthWeakening` | **Escalate** | `blocked` / `guardrail` |
| `consecutiveBlocked >= maxConsecutiveBlocked` | **Stop loop** | `blocked` / `consecutive-blocked` (default threshold `3`) |
| PR checks red after open and `babysitCi: true` | **Block item** | `ci-red`; note in item + brief |
| PR checks red and `stopOnCiRed: true` | **Stop loop** | `blocked` / `ci-red` |
| Preflight fail (base branch, state unwritable, empty Sources without allow) | **Stop loop** | `blocked` / `preflight` |
| Mega-PR: only one of `megaPr` / `CONFIRM_MEGA_PR` present | **Stop loop** | `blocked` / `preflight` — require both or neither ([mega-pr.md](./mega-pr.md)) |
| `gh` auth missing when Sources need GitHub | **Stop loop** | `blocked` / `preflight` |
| Dry-run finished | **Stop loop** | `noop` / `dry-run` |

## Soft-park (empty / maxPrs)

`/after-hours Nm` is a **tick sleep interval**, not a wall-clock night budget. Empty queue and `maxPrs` must not kill cadence:

1. Persist `parkedReason` (`empty-queue` or `maxPrs`); do **not** set `stoppedAt` / `stopReason`.
2. Keep the in-session sentinel armed (or re-arm if dead and run not user-stopped).
3. Chat one short line (parked why); do not write a full morning brief yet.
4. On next wake: refresh Sources that support it; clear `parkedReason` when agent-ready work exists **and** `prs.length < maxPrs`; otherwise no-op and stay parked.
5. Human **stop after-hours** still kills sentinels and writes the morning brief (include any prior park in residual risk).

Dry-run / doctor remain hard stops (no sentinel).

## Dirty tree (split: interrupted vs unknown)

If `safety.stopOnDirtyTree` is true (default in example config), at **tick start** before a new claim:

1. `git status --porcelain`. Clean → continue.
2. **Interrupted residue** — state has (or just recovered) a claim with `blockReason: interrupted` / orphan `in-progress` matching this dirty tree:
   - **Do not** auto-commit half work.
   - Prefer safe undo: discard uncommitted changes on the item branch **only when** they clearly belong to that parked claim and denylist is clean; then checkout `baseBranch` (or next item branch).
   - If the tree becomes clean → park item as `blocked`/`interrupted` if not already; **continue** the night (WHILE may take the next `open` item).
   - If still dirty after a safe attempt → **Stop loop** (`stopReason: blocked`, `stopDetail: dirty-interrupt`); morning brief lists residual paths. Never invent scope to “finish” the interrupted slice.
3. **Unknown dirty** (no interrupt/orphan claim explaining the tree) → **Stop loop** immediately (`blocked` / `preflight` or `guardrail`); do not stash, commit residual, or pick work. Morning brief: residual risk = unclean tree; human must clean before next AFK.

Interrupt alone must not end the night when recovery succeeds. Unknown dirt still fail-closes.

## Auth

- Require `gh auth status` success when any source uses GitHub.
- Never embed tokens in state, brief, or PR bodies.
- Auth failure mid-run → **Stop loop** (escalate if token exposure suspected).

## Path denylist (before commit / push / PR)

Respect `safety.pathDenylist` (globs). Enforcement is **before** `git commit`, `git push`, or `gh pr create`:

1. Collect staged and unstaged changed paths (`git diff --name-only`, `git diff --cached --name-only`, plus untracked if about to add).
2. If **any** path matches a denylist glob → **Escalate**: revert/unstage those paths if safe; **do not commit, push, or open a PR**; stop loop; `stopReason: blocked`, `stopDetail: guardrail` (denylist). Lead morning Summary with the matched paths.
3. Planned edit that would touch denylist → same escalate; do not start that edit path.

Never open a PR that includes denylisted files.

## Consecutive blocked → stop loop

Track `consecutiveBlocked` in state ([state-schema.md](./state-schema.md)).

| Event | Counter |
|-------|---------|
| Item ends `blocked` or `skipped` | Increment by 1 |
| Item ends `done` | Reset to `0` |
| Loop start / bootstrap | Start at `0` |

When `consecutiveBlocked >= maxConsecutiveBlocked` (config; **default 3**):

1. **Stop loop** — kill sentinel; do not pick another item.
2. Persist `stopReason: blocked`, `stopDetail: consecutive-blocked`.
3. Write morning brief (Blocked/Skipped sections must list the streak).

Do not silently re-try the same blocked id forever in one night without new agent-ready evidence.

## CI babysit (optional, after opening a PR)

Defaults: `babysitCi: false`, `stopOnCiRed: false`.

When `babysitCi: true` and a PR was just opened this tick:

1. Poll once: `gh pr checks <pr-number-or-url>` (short wait only; do not sit all night).
2. If checks are **red** / failed:
   - Mark the work item **blocked** (`blockReason: ci-red`); set `notes` with failing check names if known.
   - If `stopOnCiRed: true` → **also Stop loop** (`stopReason: blocked`, `stopDetail: ci-red`) + morning brief.
   - If `stopOnCiRed: false` → continue queue (blocked item stays in deferred ledger).
3. Pending/yellow after one poll → leave item `done` (PR opened); note “checks not green yet” in brief if useful. Do not stop solely for pending.

When `babysitCi: false` (default): do not poll; PR stays as opened; morning human reviews CI.

## Anti–green-wash

Overnight must **not**:

- Delete, comment-out, or rewrite acceptance / verification to make a failing suite “pass”
- Mark `done` when listed `verification[]` commands were skipped
- Lower recorded `risk` without human kickoff authority

On any pressure to do so: **block** the item and explain in the morning brief.
